Using a data unification algorithm, to analyze the telemetry data collected by Daikibo Factory in Tableau .Used Excel to classify data and draw business conclusions.

Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 mins. Daikibo has been collecting this data for one month (May 2021) and they've shared this data in the form of a single JSON file.
The reason the client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:
1.	In which location did machines break the most?
2.	What are the machines that broke most often in that location?
